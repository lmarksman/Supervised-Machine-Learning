#### Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model raw data

I expect the Logical Regression model to perform better considering it is using the raw data.

#### Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction?

The Random Forest Classifier scored better with the raw data. I would have expected the Logical Regression model to perform better.

Since the Random Forest model scored better in the raw data, scaling should produce a better model then the Logical Regression

When scaling the data the Logical Regression model now performs better. This was unexpected as I would have thought with scaling the data it would have remained fairly consistent.
