Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model raw data

Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction?

The Random Forest Classifier scored better with the raw data. I would have expected the Logical Regression model to perform better.



When scaling the data the Logical Regression model now performs better. This was unexpected as I would have thought with scaling the data it would have remained fairly consistent.
